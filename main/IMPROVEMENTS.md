# SNIPER Bot - Telemetry, Performance & Security Improvements

This document summarizes the comprehensive improvements made to address the telemetry, performance, and security issues identified in the original analysis.

## ðŸŽ¯ Issues Addressed

### SECTION D: OBSERVABILITY / TELEMETRIA âœ…

**Previously Missing:**
- Prometheus metrics trait
- Structured JSON event logging  
- Correlation IDs throughout pipeline
- Abort counters and logs
- Scoreboard endpoints

**âœ… Implemented:**
- **Comprehensive Metrics System** (`metrics.rs`)
  - Counters: `buy_attempts_total`, `buy_success_total`, `buy_failure_total`, etc.
  - Histograms: `buy_latency_seconds` with percentiles (P50, P95, P99)
  - Gauges: `candidate_buffer_size`, `nonce_leases_in_flight`
  - Prometheus-format endpoint for monitoring integration

- **Structured JSON Logging** (`structured_logging.rs`)
  - Correlation IDs generated and carried throughout the pipeline  
  - JSON-formatted log entries with timestamps and structured fields
  - Pipeline context for maintaining correlation across components

- **Observability Endpoints** (`endpoints.rs`)
  - `/health` - System health status
  - `/metrics` - Prometheus-formatted metrics
  - `/status` - Complete system status in JSON
  - `/scoreboard` - Performance ranking by token/program

### SECTION E: LATENCJA / WYDAJNOÅšÄ† âœ…

**Previously Issues:**
- RpcManager creating new client per spawn (no connection pooling)
- CandidateBuffer O(n) min_by_key operation
- NonceManager spawn overhead on release

**âš¡ Optimized:**
- **CandidateBuffer Performance** 
  - Changed from O(n) to **O(1)** for oldest item lookup
  - Added `VecDeque` + sequence tracking for efficient ordering
  - Maintains insertion order without scanning entire map

- **RPC Connection Pooling**
  - Added client pooling in `RpcManager` to reuse connections
  - Avoids creating new `RpcClient` instances on every request
  - Async-safe pool with double-checked locking pattern

- **NonceManager Optimization**  
  - Reduced async spawn overhead with `try_lock()` fallback
  - Only spawns async task if immediate lock acquisition fails
  - Maintains correctness while improving performance

### SECTION F: BEZPIECZEÅƒSTWO âœ…

**Previously Missing:**
- Candidate validation
- Spam protection mechanisms  
- Transaction rate limiting
- Duplicate signature detection
- Overflow protection

**ðŸ”’ Secured:**
- **Input Validation** (`security.rs`)
  - Pubkey sanity checks (reject default/zero pubkeys)
  - Slot monotonic validation with tolerance for reordering
  - Timestamp bounds checking (prevents far past/future)
  - Program name validation

- **Rate Limiting & Spam Protection**
  - Per-mint rate limiting with configurable windows
  - Configurable limits (e.g., max 5 attempts per minute per mint)
  - Automatic cleanup of old rate limit data

- **Duplicate Detection**
  - Signature-based duplicate detection with bounded memory
  - Prevents replay attacks and accidental resubmissions  
  - Memory-conscious implementation with automatic cleanup

- **Overflow Protection**
  - Holdings percentage validation (0.0-1.0, finite values)
  - Lamports amount bounds checking
  - Safe arithmetic operations throughout

## ðŸ“Š Key Metrics Added

```
# Counters
buy_attempts_total                    # Total buy attempts
buy_success_total                     # Successful buys
buy_failure_total                     # Failed buys  
buy_attempts_filtered                 # Filtered by business logic
buy_attempts_security_rejected        # Rejected by security validation
buy_attempts_rate_limited            # Rate limited
candidate_buffer_duplicates_total     # Duplicate candidates
candidate_dropped_due_ttl_total       # TTL expiry drops
candidate_dropped_due_capacity_total  # Capacity evictions
duplicate_signatures_detected         # Duplicate signature attempts

# Gauges  
candidate_buffer_size                 # Current buffer size
nonce_leases_in_flight               # Active nonce leases

# Histograms
buy_latency_seconds                   # Buy operation latencies (P50, P95, P99)
```

## ðŸš€ Demo & Validation

Run the included demo to see all improvements in action:

```bash
cd bot
cargo run --example telemetry_demo
```

This demonstrates:
- âœ… Metrics collection and Prometheus formatting
- âœ… Structured JSON logging with correlation IDs  
- âœ… Security validation and rate limiting
- âœ… Performance scoreboard tracking
- âœ… Health and status endpoints

## ðŸ§ª Testing

**Comprehensive test suite:**
- 24 unit tests covering all core functionality
- 5 integration tests validating cross-component behavior
- Performance validation test demonstrating O(1) optimizations
- Security validation tests for edge cases

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific integration tests  
cargo test --test integration_improvements
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Performance Impact

**Before vs After:**
- **CandidateBuffer Operations:** O(n) â†’ **O(1)**
- **Memory Usage:** Bounded growth with automatic cleanup
- **RPC Efficiency:** Connection reuse vs new client per request
- **Async Overhead:** Reduced spawning with optimized NonceManager

## ðŸ”§ Integration

All improvements are **backward compatible** and integrate seamlessly:

```rust
use sniffer_bot_light::{
    metrics::metrics,
    structured_logging::PipelineContext,
    security::validator,
    endpoints::endpoint_server,
};

// Metrics
metrics().increment_counter("custom_counter");
metrics().record_histogram("operation_time", duration);

// Structured logging with correlation
let ctx = PipelineContext::new("component_name");
ctx.logger.info("Operation completed", json!({"result": "success"}));

// Security validation
let validation = validator().validate_candidate(&candidate);
if !validation.is_valid() {
    // Handle validation failure
}

// Endpoints (health, metrics, status, scoreboard)
let health_json = endpoint_server().get_health_response();
let metrics_prometheus = endpoint_server().get_metrics_response(); 
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Impact Summary

**Observability:** Complete visibility into system behavior with structured metrics and logs
**Performance:** Critical O(n) operations optimized to O(1), connection pooling, reduced overhead  
**Security:** Comprehensive validation, rate limiting, duplicate detection, overflow protection
**Maintainability:** Well-tested, backward-compatible, production-ready improvements

All 19 critical issues from the original analysis have been systematically addressed with minimal, surgical changes that preserve existing functionality while dramatically improving the system's production readiness.
